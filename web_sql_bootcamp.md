I took this bootcamp (is actually a [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-ultimate-mysql-bootcamp-go-from-sql-beginner-to-expert/) course!) as a "catch up class" after SENAI course, since I felt that I enjoyed databases and would like to deepen my knowledge about it. What I loved about it is that it goes from the basics (creating databases & tables, understanding different datatypes, and CRUD operations) to more complex topics, like functions, joins, views and models.

To me, it was the door that connected me to the A-M-A-Z-I-N-G data world, but also that gave me the fundamental tools to start my data analysis exploration 👩‍💻. 

I've created a [Github Repository](https://github.com/May30Sal/Ultimate_SQL_Bootcamp_Course) where I share all the notes, exercises and activities I've developed during the classes. It's also fun to go back to it as a reference every time I have a doubt about a topic 🧐  or that I'm stuck in how to create a specific query 😰.
