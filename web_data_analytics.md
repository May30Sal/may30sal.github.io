**Google Data Analytics**

The courses from Google teaches the core technologies and skills necessary to succeed in the data analysis field. It is provided in partnership with [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-data-analytics).

I have finished 3 of them so far, and they have given me a good overview of the field:

✅ **Foundations: Data, Data, Everywhere:** define and explain key concepts involved in data analytics, help to develop  analytical thinking, and discuss the main tolls used in data analytics (spreadsheets, query languages, and data visualization tools).

✅ **Ask Questions to Make Data-Driven Decisions:** explore how to develop problem-solving and structured thinking skills in order to make data-driven decisions. 

✅ **Prepare Data for Exploration:** discuss the best practices for organizing and collecting data, and also about bias. Introduces the basics of databases using SQL and excel spreadsheets.
