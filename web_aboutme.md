### My story 🐝 

My master's in History was an unexpected gateway to the data revolution. From passionately deciphering cryptic medieval spanish legal documents in the 13th century, to orchestrating monthly meetings and end-of-year conferences (with 50 presenters!), it led me to this self-directed computational journey!

### Why you may want to hire me ☑️ 	

Sure, I don't have years of formal data experience, but I offer something rarer: a passionate, quick-thinking mind with a proven ability to extract order and knowledge from chaos. 

Think of me as a hidden gem, ready to magically unlock the secrets whispered within your data and drive your business forward!
