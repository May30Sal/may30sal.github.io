My name is Mayara Saldanha, and I have the following professional qualities:

✔️  I listen well.<br>
✔️  I am organized.<br>
✔️  I learn rapidly.<br>
✔️  I know Excel, Python, SQL, Git & JS.<br>
✔️  I know about UML and ERDs.<br>

### My story 🐝 

My master’s in History was an unexpected path to the data revolution. From passionately analyzing digitized 13th century medieval legal documents, to organizing online monthly meetings and yearly conferences (with 50ish presenters!), it led me on this self-directed computational journey! 

### Why you may want to hire me ☑️ 	

Sure, I don't have years of formal data experience, but I can offer something rarer: a quick-thinking mind, a willingness to learn, and a proven ability set up order from chaos.
