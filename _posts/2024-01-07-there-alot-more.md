My name is Mayara Saldanha and I’m creating this website to document my journey through the Technology field.  I have a humanities background, but during the pandemic I decided to seek for an adventure with programming and code [and started with MIT's Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/).

Through the ins and outs of teaching myself how to code and reading a lot of blogs and books about it I and ended up discovering the power of Data! This was my “aha” moment, when I figured out how data analysis and humanities are connected and how much of my previous knowledge I could bring into my recently studies.

With that said, the goal of this website is to share a little bit of what I’ve been learning and developing regarding to programming, code, data, and ethical-social considerations (eg. bias, privacy, etc.). And also, connecting with people and companies that could be of great value for my professional development.
