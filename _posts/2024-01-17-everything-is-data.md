When I started taking my **Google Data Analysis Certification** around 2 months ago I was amazed by how data is everywhere. From the weather app we look at every morning, to the songs or videos we are suggested to listen or watch, everything is data.

The interesting point though, is that we usually donâ€™t pay attention to or even realize it until we start actually studying it. When we understand the power of data to have wider and argument-based perceptions it feels like we are armed with just the right tools to have better decisions.

One cool task I did during my first module of this certification was to create my own database about something related to my daily life. I choose to track my study hours, and during around 3 weeks I gathered information about time, subjects and places I was studying at.

<div style="font-size:2rem;width:100%;text-align:center;">
<img 
  align="center" 
  style="width:auto; height:auto; border: .25em solid #00bfa5; "

  alt="spreadsheet image">    
</div>

After that, I calculated the average of studying I was doing per day and built a chart showing my study time daily.

One thing that I noticed was that studying at home was making me very inconstant with time, some days I would study for 2 hours and others for only 10 minutes. Even knowing that I had time to be more regular about it. So I decided to move my study place to a library, which would cease the distraction I had at home and make my study time more productive and regular.

<div style="font-size:2rem;width:100%;text-align:center;">
<img 
  align="center" 
  style="width:auto; height:auto; border: .25em solid #00bfa5; "
  src="/assets/img/img2-01-17-2024.png" 
  alt="spreadsheet image">    
</div>

It was a pretty simple first analysis, but the goal was achieved: see how everything can be turned into data that can be analyzed and whose insights will help us make better and more consciousness decisions.
