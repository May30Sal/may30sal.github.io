### My story

My master's in History was an unexpected gateway to the data revolution. From deciphering cryptic medevial spanish legal documents in the 13th century, to orchestrating monthly meetings and end-of-year conferences (with 50 presenters!), I learned the intricate art of building narratives from fragmented data and information. This foundation proved crucial as I embarked on my journey to decipher the stories whispered within terabytes of digital data.
