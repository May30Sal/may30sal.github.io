Hello! My name is Mayara Saldhana 🇨🇦, and I have the following professional qualities:
  - I listen well.
  - I am organized.
  - I learn rapidly.
  - I know Python, SQL, & JavaScript. 

### My story 🐝

My master's in History was an unexpected gateway to the data revolution. From deciphering cryptic medevial spanish legal documents in the 13th century, to orchestrating monthly meetings and end-of-year conferences (with 50 presenters!).

In it, I learned the intricate art of coalescing knowledge from fragmented data. This foundation proved crucial as I embarked on my computational journey to decipher the stories whispered within terabytes of digital data.

### Why you may want to hire me ✅

I listen intently, absorb information like a sponge, and my coding in Python, SQL, and JavaScript proves I'm a fast learner. 

Sure, I don't have years of formal data experience, but I offer something rarer: a passionate, quick-thinking mind with a proven ability to extract stories from chaos. Think of me as a hidden gem, ready to unlock the secrets whispered within your data and drive your business forward.
