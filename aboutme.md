My name is Mayara Saldhana, and I have the following professional qualities:

✅  I listen well.<br>
✅  I am organized.<br>
✅  I learn rapidly.<br>
✅  I know Python, SQL, & JavaScript.<br>
<br>

### My story 🐝

My master's in History was an unexpected gateway to the data revolution. From deciphering cryptic medieval spanish legal documents in the 13th century, to orchestrating monthly meetings and end-of-year conferences (with 50 presenters!), I learned the intricate art of coalescing knowledge from fragmented data. This foundation proved crucial as I embarked on my computational journey to decipher the stories whispered within terabytes of digital data.

### Why you may want to hire me ✅

Sure, I don't have years of formal data experience, but I offer something rarer: a passionate, quick-thinking mind with a proven ability to extract order and knowledge from chaos. Think of me as a hidden gem, ready to unlock the secrets whispered within your data and drive your business forward: I listen intently, absorb information like a sponge, and my coding in Python, SQL, and JavaScript proves I'm a fast learner.
