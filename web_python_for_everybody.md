subtitle: Specialization
---

In this specialization, we learn how to program and analyze data with Python, one of the most popular programming languages. The content covers since the basics concepts (like variables, functions and loops), until the more complex topics, such as integration with databases and API's. It is based on the class and book from the professor Dr. Chuck, that is also available for free in his [website](https://www.py4e.com/){:target="_blank"}.

The course is provided in partnership with [Coursera and University of Michigan](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/python){:target="_blank"}, and the curriculum goes as follows:

‚úÖ **Programming for Everybody (Getting Started with Python):** explore the basics of python programming language, like synthax and semantics, conditional execution, functions, and iteration.

‚úÖ **Python Data Structures:** explain the principles of data structures & how they are used. Understand strings, tuples, files, lists, and dictionaries in python.

‚úÖ **Using Python to Access Web Data:** using RegEx to extract data from strings. Retrieve data from websites and APIs using python and work with XML & Json files.

‚úÖ **Using Databases with Python:** use CRUD (create, read, update, delete) operations to interact with databases. Learn about Object-Oriented Programming in python.

‚úÖ **Capstone: Retrieving, Processing, and Visualizing Data with Python:** creating real-wolrd projects in python.

I share all the exercises and projects that I've developed during the course in this [Github Repository](https://github.com/May30Sal/Python_For_Everybody_Course){:target="_blank"} <img style="width:5%; height:5%;"
