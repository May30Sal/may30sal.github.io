I started this course during Covid-19 pandemic, and it was my first "official" programming course.
At that time (2021), it was totally online and give me the fundamental knowledge about web development, databases, APIs, tests, etc.

This course is provided by [SENAI](https://www.futuro.digital/dn-programador-full-stack-qua056-119-670h/p?skuId=6602)
and the curriculum goes as follows:

✅ **Agile Methodologies:** Scrum, kanban, LEAN principles, and tools like Trello.

✅ **Version Control:** Git and Github.

✅ **Programming Logic:** what's an algorithm and how to problme-solve with code. How to use conditional statements and loops (if-else, swicth, for, while, do-while), variables and functions. Data types and operators.

✅ **Coding for Front-End:** how to create web pages using HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap, Javascript & DOM, and JQuery. The first part of the final project that I developed for this class can be found in better details in this [Github Repository](https://github.com/May30Sal/Game_Mania_Store_Website_1).

✅ **Frameworks and API:** improving web pages with Angular framework and API's. Complete version of the final project is available [here](https://github.com/May30Sal/Game_Mania_Store_Website_2) and [here](https://github.com/May30Sal/Game_Mania_Store_API).
