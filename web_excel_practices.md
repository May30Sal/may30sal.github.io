One of the most famous and popular tools for data manipulation, analysis and visualization is Excel. It's also the easiest to learn and to use in our daily lives, some examples are the spreasheets that we make to organize our personal budget, to plan a vacation trip or even to track our (un)healthy habits! 

Because I'm passionate about organization, I also like to make some random excel spreadsheets just for fun, to manage my agenda, tracking my study time, etc. And now that I'm learning about data analysis, I'm having a good time discovering more about functions, different types of charts (bars, line 💹, pie 🍕😋).

As part of the **Google Data Analysis Certification** I work a lot with spreadsheets and public data, in order to build a data-driven, problem-solving mindset. In addition, the practice makes it easier to learn how to clean, organize, manage, and interpret all types of data.

[Here](https://github.com/May30Sal/Excel_Practices) I'll upload part of these activities, some eventually will be turned into a data analysis project (or at least I intend them to be!), and others will be just me trying to get a better knowledge about how to use excel at all.
